## About

Hello, my name is Julie!

I'm photographer based in Prague, but I'm open to take picture anywhere you want.
Photography and travelling around the world are my lovers and I am happy to capture things that fascinate me.

## More about me

I'm student of photography and I like to create new things. I have always been an extrovert and I like to communicate with people. I started my journey with a camera at the age of 13, when I got my first camera under the christmas tree. At the age of 16, I published my first cookbook and became more interested in professional photography. I photographed the second cookbook by myself, as I had more experience in food photography. Now I take pictures of food for cookbooks and on my blog. I like to take photos on my journeys and portraits or product photos. 

In my free time I like running, baking and cooking. I have my blog about food, where Iam writing my recipes.

## Project 1

Cookbook for Smartpress publisher was my biggest photography project. After a long search for a photographer for my second book, I decided to photograph it myself. I learned everything about food photography by myself at that time. I cooked and photographed 90 recipes for the book. I mainly focused on colors and simple decoration to make the food look realistic. I didn't use any fake food. The book was published in 2022 and Its available in every bookshop in Czech Republic. 
The final product is Kuchařka pro mě a moje tělo and It exist around 5000 books.

### Project 2

I made this work this year for my final thesis at my school. As you can see, I really like to take pictures about food. My topic was focused on how the photos look before and after the shoot. Before the photo shoot, It is time for foodstyling and choosing a suitable decoration, which sometimes takes many hours. I need good lights, composition and nice dishes. After the photo is taken it's time to eat the food and it takes only few minutes to ruin the setup and ecerything.
