## About

Hello, my name is Julie!
I'm photographer based in Prague, but I'm open to take picture anywhere you want.
Photography and travelling around the world are my lovers and I am happy to capture things that fascinate me.

## More about me

I'm student of photography and I like to create new things. I have always been an extrovert and I like to communicate with people. I started my journey with a camera at the age of 13, when I got my first camera under the christmas tree. At the age of 16, I published my first cookbook and became more interested in professional photography. I photographed the second cookbook by myself, as I had more experience in food photography. Now I take pictures of food for cookbooks and on my blog. I like to take photos on my journeys and portraits or product photos. 

In my free time I like running, baking and cooking. I have my blog about food, where Iam writing my recipes.

## Project 1

Cookbook for Smartpress publisher was my biggest photography project. After a long search for a photographer for my second book, I decided to photograph it myself. I learned everything about food photography by myself at that time. I cooked and photographed 90 recipes for the book. I mainly focused on colors and simple decoration to make the food look realistic. I didn't use any fake food.

### Project 2

<!-- Use a static poster image or animated GIF, but no video files. Again, keep the image width/height manageable, around 1280x x 720px (16:9 aspect ratio), or a max-width of 1280px. -->
